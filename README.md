Download this repository to create simple lifespan maps on a small map extent as explained in the open-access paper ["Lifespan map creation enhances stream restoration design"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016119300913). Please note that the entire dataset used in the lead paper is too big for this repository and we provided a large set of lifespan maps in the [supplemental data file of the lead paper (multimedia component)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718312751). This repository provides a small dataset within a basic *Python* code and with PDF documentation.

For a flexible, enhanced, and relevant experience of lifespan mapping please consider using [*River Architect*](https://riverarchitect.github.io). Read more about *River Architect*s lifespan mapping module on its [wiki pages](https://riverarchitect.github.io/RA_wiki/LifespanDesign).

## Run codes
Use ESRI's *Python2* environment (provided with *ArcMap*) to run `codes/make_gui.py`. The required `python.exe` is typically stored in `C:/Python27/ArcGISx6410.X/python.exe`. For more information, read the code manual (`code/Documentation/CodeDocumentation.pdf`) or use [*River Architect*](https://riverarchitect.github.io) (strongly recommended).
